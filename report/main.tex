\begin{abstract}
Methane (CH$_4$) is a potent greenhouse gas, and accurately identifying and quantifying its emission sources is crucial for climate change mitigation. This report details the development and validation of an end-to-end Python pipeline for detecting and quantifying methane emission hotspots using data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the Sentinel-5P satellite. The pipeline leverages Google Earth Engine for efficient data acquisition and initial processing of COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3\_CH4 data. The methodology incorporates robust atmospheric data processing, including quality filtering and background methane concentration estimation using temporal medians and spatial percentiles. Statistical anomaly detection is performed using a rolling window Z-score approach, combined with an absolute enhancement threshold, to identify potential emission plumes. Detected anomalies are spatially clustered using connected component labeling and filtered for temporal persistence to enhance reliability. Emission rates for identified hotspots are quantified using a simplified mass balance method, with a comprehensive uncertainty analysis considering contributions from instrument precision, wind data, boundary layer height estimates, and model simplifications. The pipeline's architecture is modular, featuring YAML-based configuration, extensive error handling, and Docker containerization for reproducibility and deployment. Validation was performed over diverse regions, including the Netherlands, the Permian Basin (USA), Houston, and Los Angeles, demonstrating the pipeline's capability to identify known emission areas and maintain low false positive rates in clean regions. The system provides outputs in multiple formats (NetCDF, CSV, GeoJSON) and includes visualization tools for scientific analysis and reporting. This work presents a reproducible and extensible framework for methane hotspot monitoring, contributing to improved atmospheric research and environmental policy support.

\section{Introduction}
Methane (CH$_4$) is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) in terms of radiative forcing, but has a global warming potential approximately 84 times greater than CO$_2$ over a 20-year period \citep{IPCCAR6}. Anthropogenic sources, including agriculture, fossil fuel production and use, and waste management, contribute significantly to the atmospheric methane budget. Mitigating methane emissions is considered a key short-term strategy to limit global warming \citep{UNEPGlobalMethane}. Accurate and timely information on the location and magnitude of methane emission sources is therefore essential for effective mitigation policies, industrial accountability, and scientific understanding of the methane cycle.

Satellite remote sensing offers a powerful tool for monitoring atmospheric methane concentrations globally and repeatedly. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P) satellite, launched in October 2017, provides daily global measurements of atmospheric methane columns with unprecedented spatial resolution (initially $\sim$7 km $\times$ 3.5 km, now $\sim$5.5 km $\times$ 3.5 km at nadir) and precision \citep{Hu2018TROPOMI}. This enhanced capability allows for the detection and quantification of methane emissions from localized hotspots, such as those associated with oil and gas infrastructure, landfills, and coal mines \citep{Zhang2020Permian, Varon2018}.

While TROPOMI provides a wealth of data, transforming these observations into actionable information on emission hotspots requires sophisticated processing pipelines. These pipelines must handle large data volumes, apply rigorous quality control, distinguish localized enhancements from background variability, attribute these enhancements to potential sources, and quantify emission rates with associated uncertainties. Google Earth Engine (GEE) has emerged as a powerful platform for planetary-scale geospatial analysis, providing access to TROPOMI data archives and cloud-based computational resources, thereby facilitating the development of such pipelines \citep{Gorelick2017GEE}.

This report describes the development, implementation, and validation of a comprehensive, end-to-end Python pipeline for detecting and quantifying methane emission hotspots using TROPOMI Level 3 (L3) CH$_4$ data accessed via GEE. The research objectives were:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To design and implement a robust pipeline for automated methane hotspot detection from TROPOMI L3 data.
    \item To integrate advanced data processing techniques, including statistical anomaly detection, spatial clustering, and temporal persistence analysis.
    \item To develop a methodology for quantifying methane emission rates from detected hotspots using a simplified mass balance approach and to characterize the associated uncertainties.
    \item To validate the pipeline's performance across diverse geographical regions with varying emission characteristics.
    \item To create a modular, reproducible, and open-source framework that can be adapted for other trace gases or satellite missions.
\end{enumerate}

The pipeline detailed herein integrates atmospheric data processing, statistical anomaly detection, spatial clustering, and emission quantification with uncertainty analysis. This report is structured as follows: Section \ref{sec:methodology} describes the data sources and the mathematical framework underpinning the detection and quantification algorithms. Section \ref{sec:implementation} details the software architecture, pipeline modules, and production features. Section \ref{sec:results_discussion} presents validation results from test regions and discusses the pipeline's performance. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusions_future} summarizes the key findings and outlines potential avenues for future research and development. This work aims to provide a valuable resource for atmospheric scientists, remote sensing specialists, and environmental engineers engaged in methane monitoring and mitigation efforts.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
This section outlines the data sources, data processing steps, and the mathematical and statistical methods employed in the TROPOMI methane hotspot detection pipeline.

\subsection{Data Source and Acquisition}
\subsubsection{TROPOMI Satellite and Data Product}
The primary data source for this pipeline is the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI instrument. TROPOMI is a passive nadir-viewing spectrometer measuring solar radiation backscattered by the Earth's atmosphere and reflected by the surface. It covers ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands. Methane column concentrations are retrieved from SWIR measurements around 2.3 \textmu m \citep{Hu2018TROPOMI}.

The specific data product used is the COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3\_CH4, which provides Level 3 offline global gridded methane column-averaged dry-air mole fractions (XCH$_4$). Level 3 data represent sensor observations that have been spatially and/or temporally resampled onto a uniform grid.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spatial Resolution}: The native TROPOMI resolution is approximately 7 km $\times$ 3.5 km at nadir (prior to August 2019, after which it improved to $\sim$5.5 km $\times$ 3.5 km). L3 products are typically provided on a regular latitude-longitude grid (e.g., 0.01$^{\circ}$ $\times$ 0.01$^{\circ}$).
    \item \textbf{Temporal Coverage}: TROPOMI provides near-daily global coverage.
    \item \textbf{Data Format}: The underlying data are typically distributed in NetCDF format. When accessed via Google Earth Engine, they are represented as Image Collections. Processing within the Python pipeline often utilizes xarray for handling these multi-dimensional datasets.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Google Earth Engine Platform}
Google Earth Engine (GEE) is used for efficient access to the TROPOMI L3 CH$_4$ data archive and for initial server-side processing, such as spatial and temporal filtering and regional subsetting. This minimizes data download requirements and leverages GEE's parallel processing capabilities.

\subsubsection{Quality Filtering}
Raw satellite retrievals can be affected by various factors, including cloud cover, aerosols, and surface albedo variations. Rigorous quality filtering is crucial:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{QA Flags}: The TROPOMI L2 product (from which L3 is derived) includes a quality assurance value (``qa\_value''). A common threshold is to use pixels with qa\_value > 0.5 (or 0.7 for stricter filtering) to ensure high-quality retrievals.
    \item \textbf{Cloud Fraction Thresholds}: Pixels significantly contaminated by clouds are filtered out. TROPOMI products often include cloud information, or auxiliary cloud products can be used. For L3 data, this filtering is often pre-applied, but checks are necessary.
    \item \textbfSurface Albedo Filtering}: Retrievals over dark surfaces (e.g., water bodies with low SWIR albedo) or highly heterogeneous terrains can be less reliable.
\end{itemize}
The specific L3 product COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3\_CH4 already incorporates significant quality control. Our pipeline applies further checks based on recommended practices for this product.

\subsection{Mathematical Framework}
\subsubsection{Background Concentration Calculation}
To identify methane enhancements indicative of emission plumes, it is necessary to estimate the background methane concentration that would be present in the absence of local sources. The pipeline employs a two-step approach:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Temporal Background}: For each pixel $(i,j)$ in the spatial grid, a temporal background $XCH_{4,bg\_temporal}(i,j)$ is calculated as the median of XCH$_4$ concentrations over a defined time window (e.g., 30-90 days) for that specific pixel:
    \begin{equation}
        XCH_{4,bg\_temporal}(i,j) = \text{median}_{t \in T_w} (XCH_{4,obs}(i,j,t))
        \label{eq:temporal_bg}
    \end{equation}
    where $XCH_{4,obs}(i,j,t)$ is the observed methane concentration at pixel $(i,j)$ and time $t$, and $T_w$ is the temporal window. This helps to account for seasonal variations and long-term trends.

    \item \textbf{Spatial Background}: A regional spatial background $XCH_{4,bg\_spatial}(t)$ for a given observation time $t$ is determined by calculating a percentile (default 50th, i.e., median) of the observed $XCH_{4,obs}$ values within a defined geographical region, after potentially removing strong outliers.
    \begin{equation}
        XCH_{4,bg\_spatial}(t) = P_k (XCH_{4,obs}(i,j,t) \text{ for all } (i,j) \in R)
        \label{eq:spatial_bg}
    \end{equation}
    where $P_k$ is the $k$-th percentile (e.g., $k=50$) and $R$ is the geographical region of interest.
    The final background $XCH_{4,background}$ for a pixel can be a combination of these or selected based on the specific analysis context (e.g., using the spatial background for daily plume detection). For plume detection on a single day's image, the spatial background is often preferred.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Enhancement Calculation}
The methane enhancement ($\Delta XCH_4$) is defined as the difference between the observed concentration and the estimated background concentration:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta XCH_4(i,j,t) = XCH_{4,obs}(i,j,t) - XCH_{4,background}(i,j,t)
    \label{eq:enhancement}
\end{equation}
This enhancement is typically expressed in parts per billion (ppb).

The relative enhancement ($\Delta XCH_{4,rel}$) can also be calculated:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta XCH_{4,rel}(i,j,t) = \left( \frac{XCH_{4,obs}(i,j,t)}{XCH_{4,background}(i,j,t)} - 1 \right) \times 100\%
    \label{eq:rel_enhancement}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Statistical Anomaly Detection Algorithm}
Anomalies are identified based on both statistical significance and absolute magnitude. A rolling window approach is used to define local statistics:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Local Statistics}: For each pixel $(i,j)$, a spatial window (e.g., $5 \times 5$ pixels, corresponding to approximately $35 \text{ km} \times 17.5 \text{ km}$) is defined around it. The local mean ($\mu_{local}$) and local standard deviation ($\sigma_{local}$) of the methane enhancements ($\Delta XCH_4$) within this window are calculated.
    \begin{align}
        \mu_{local}(i,j,t) &= \text{mean}(\Delta XCH_4(x,y,t)) \quad \forall (x,y) \in W_{ij} \\
        \sigma_{local}(i,j,t) &= \text{std}(\Delta XCH_4(x,y,t)) \quad \forall (x,y) \in W_{ij}
    \end{align}
    where $W_{ij}$ is the set of pixels in the rolling window centered at $(i,j)$.

    \item \textbf{Z-score Calculation}: The Z-score for the enhancement at each pixel is calculated as:
    \begin{equation}
        Z(i,j,t) = \frac{\Delta XCH_4(i,j,t) - \mu_{local}(i,j,t)}{\sigma_{local}(i,j,t)}
        \label{eq:zscore}
    \end{equation}
    A high Z-score indicates that the pixel's enhancement is significantly larger than its local surroundings.

    \item \textbf{Anomaly Criteria}: A pixel is flagged as an anomaly if it meets combined criteria:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Statistical significance: $Z(i,j,t) > Z_{thresh}$ (e.g., $Z_{thresh} = 2.0$).
        \item Absolute magnitude: $\Delta XCH_4(i,j,t) > \Delta XCH_{4,min}$ (e.g., $\Delta XCH_{4,min} = 20 \text{ ppb}$).
    \end{itemize}
    Both conditions must be met to reduce false positives from pixels that are statistically significant but have very small absolute enhancements, or vice-versa.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Spatial Clustering Method}
Anomalous pixels identified in the previous step are often spatially grouped if they originate from the same emission plume.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Algorithm}: Connected component labeling is applied to the binary map of anomalous pixels. The `scipy.ndimage.label` function is commonly used for this purpose \citep{ScipyNdimage}.
    \item \textbf{Connectivity}: An 8-connected neighborhood is typically used, meaning pixels are considered connected if they share an edge or a corner.
    \item \textbf{Minimum Cluster Size}: Clusters smaller than a minimum size (e.g., 4 pixels) are discarded to reduce noise and isolated false positives. This threshold depends on the expected plume size and instrument resolution.
\end{enumerate}
Each resulting cluster represents a potential methane hotspot plume.

\subsubsection{Temporal Persistence Analysis}
To further increase confidence in detected hotspots and distinguish persistent sources from transient events, a temporal persistence analysis is performed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Persistence Calculation}: For each pixel location $(i,j)$, the fraction of time steps (days with valid observations) where an anomaly (or part of a cluster) is detected at that location is calculated over a defined observation period (e.g., a month, a season, or a year).
    \begin{equation}
        P_{persist}(i,j) = \frac{\text{Number of times anomaly detected at } (i,j)}{\text{Total number of valid observations at } (i,j)}
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Persistence Threshold}: A location is considered a persistent hotspot if $P_{persist}(i,j) > P_{thresh}$ (e.g., $P_{thresh} = 0.20$, meaning an anomaly is detected on at least 20\% of observed days).
    \item \textbf{Final Hotspot Definition}: A final hotspot is defined as a spatially clustered group of anomalous pixels that also exhibits temporal persistence above the specified threshold. This helps to filter out sporadic anomalies and highlight consistent emission sources.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Emission Quantification Model}
Once a hotspot is confirmed, its emission rate ($E$) is estimated using a simplified mass balance method. This approach assumes that the observed methane enhancement downwind of a source is proportional to the emission rate, wind speed, and inversely related to mixing height and plume dispersion. A common formulation is:
\begin{equation}
    E = \frac{\Delta c_{mass} \times A \times U}{L_{char}}
    \label{eq:emission_rate_general}
\end{equation}
The user-provided formula is $E = (\Delta C \times A \times U) / H$. We interpret $\Delta C$ as the enhancement in methane mass concentration within the boundary layer $(\Delta c_{mass})$ in kg/m$^3$.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Column Density Conversion and Mass Concentration Enhancement}:
    The observed enhancement $\Delta XCH_4$ (in ppb, from Eq. \ref{eq:enhancement}) is a column-averaged dry-air mole fraction. To convert this to an average mass concentration enhancement $\Delta c_{mass}$ (kg/m$^3$) within the boundary layer (BL) of height $H$:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Convert ppb enhancement to a unitless VMR: $\Delta XCH_{4,vmr} = \Delta XCH_{4,ppb} \times 10^{-9}$.
        \item Assume this VMR enhancement is representative of conditions within the BL.
        \item Convert VMR to mass concentration:
            \begin{equation}
                \Delta c_{mass} [\text{kg/m}^3] = \Delta XCH_{4,vmr} \times \rho_{air} \times \frac{M_{CH_4}}{M_{air}}
                \label{eq:delta_c_mass}
            \end{equation}
            where:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $\rho_{air}$ is the air density in the boundary layer (e.g., $\approx 1.2 \text{ kg/m}^3$ at $15^\circ\text{C}$, 1 atm).
                \item $M_{CH_4}$ is the molar mass of methane ($\approx 0.01604 \text{ kg/mol}$).
                \item $M_{air}$ is the mean molar mass of dry air ($\approx 0.02896 \text{ kg/mol}$).
            \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    This $\Delta c_{mass}$ is the $\Delta C$ term in the user's formula.

    \item \textbf{Emission Rate Formula}: The emission rate $E$ (kg/s) is then calculated using the provided formula:
    \begin{equation}
        E [\text{kg/s}] = \frac{\Delta c_{mass} [\text{kg/m}^3] \times A [\text{m}^2] \times U [\text{m/s}]}{H [\text{m}]}
        \label{eq:emission_rate}
    \end{equation}
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\Delta c_{mass}$ is the average methane mass concentration enhancement over the hotspot area, derived from $\Delta XCH_4$ as per Eq. \ref{eq:delta_c_mass}. For a cluster, this could be the maximum or average enhancement within the cluster.
        \item $A$ is the area of the hotspot pixel or cluster (m$^2$).
        \item $U$ is the effective wind speed at plume height (m/s). An average value (e.g., 5 m/s) is assumed if real-time meteorological data are not integrated.
        \item $H$ is the atmospheric mixing height or boundary layer height (m). An average value (e.g., 1000 m) is assumed if not dynamically determined.
    \end{itemize}
    This formula is a simplification. More complex methods, like integrated methane enhancement (IME) or Gaussian plume inversion, can provide more accurate estimates but require more detailed plume characterization and meteorological data \citep{Varon2018}.

    \item \textbf{Unit Conversions}: The emission rate $E$ can be converted to other units:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item kg/hr: $E_{kg/hr} = E_{kg/s} \times 3600$
        \item tonnes/year: $E_{tonnes/year} = E_{kg/s} \times 3600 \times 24 \times 365.25 / 1000$
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Uncertainty Quantification}
Quantifying the uncertainty in emission estimates is critical. The total uncertainty arises from several sources:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Measurement Uncertainty ($\sigma_{meas}$)}: TROPOMI XCH$_4$ retrievals have an estimated precision. The user specifies 1.5\% for this value. This uncertainty propagates to $\Delta c_{mass}$.
    \item \textbf{Wind Speed Uncertainty ($\sigma_U$)}: Wind speed ($U$) is a major source of uncertainty, often estimated at $\pm 50\%$ if climatological or assumed values are used.
    \item \textbf{Boundary Layer Height Uncertainty ($\sigma_H$)}: Mixing height ($H$) also contributes significantly, estimated at $\pm 30\%$.
    \item \textbf{Area Uncertainty ($\sigma_A$)}: Uncertainty in plume area $A$ can arise from pixel resolution and clustering. Usually smaller compared to wind and BLH.
    \item \textbf{Model Uncertainty ($\sigma_{model}$)}: The simplified mass balance model itself introduces uncertainty due to assumptions about atmospheric transport, steady-state conditions, and uniform mixing. This is often characterized as a factor of 2-3.
\end{enumerate}

The relative uncertainty in the emission rate $E$ due to quantifiable input parameters is estimated by combining individual relative uncertainties in quadrature, assuming they are independent:
\begin{equation}
    \left(\frac{\sigma_E}{E}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sigma_{\Delta c_{mass}}}{\Delta c_{mass}}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sigma_A}{A}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sigma_U}{U}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sigma_H}{H}\right)^2
    \label{eq:uncertainty_prop}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{\Delta c_{mass}} / \Delta c_{mass}$ is primarily driven by $\sigma_{meas}$. The overall model uncertainty (factor of 2-3) is typically applied as a range to the final emission estimate or its calculated uncertainty. For example, if $(\sigma_E/E)_{calc} = 60\%$, the effective uncertainty range considering the model factor might be much larger.

\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Pipeline Architecture}
The pipeline is designed as a modular system, with distinct stages for different processing tasks. This promotes maintainability, testability, and extensibility. A conceptual system architecture diagram is shown in Figure \ref{fig:architecture}.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}

The core modules are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Configuration Management}:
    Utilizes YAML-based configuration files for managing all pipeline parameters, such as date ranges, regions of interest, quality filtering thresholds, anomaly detection parameters ($Z_{thresh}$, $\Delta XCH_{4,min}$), clustering settings (min cluster size), persistence thresholds, and emission quantification constants (wind speed, mixing height if not dynamic). This allows for easy modification of pipeline behavior without code changes. An example configuration snippet:

Handles authentication, defines the spatio-temporal query based on configuration, retrieves the TROPOMI L3 XCH$_4$ data (COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3\_CH4), and performs initial server-side filtering (e.g., cloud masking if necessary, QA value filtering). Data for the region of interest are typically exported from GEE or processed in memory via xarray.

    \item \textbf{Preprocessing Module}:
    Applies further client-side quality filtering if needed. Handles outlier removal beyond standard QA.

Computes methane enhancements ($\Delta XCH_4$).

    \item \textbf{Detection Module}:

\subsection{Production Features}
To ensure robustness and usability, several production-oriented features are incorporated:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Error Handling}: Comprehensive \texttt{try-except} blocks are used throughout the codebase to gracefully handle potential errors (e.g., GEE API issues, data format inconsistencies, missing data). Detailed logging using Python's \texttt{logging} module helps in debugging and monitoring.
    \item \textbf{Configuration Validation}: Input configuration parameters from YAML files are validated (e.g., using a schema validation library like \texttt{Pydantic} or custom checks) to ensure they are within valid ranges and correct types.
    \item \textbf{Command Line Interface (CLI)}: An \texttt{argparse}-based CLI allows users to run the pipeline with various options, such as specifying the configuration file, date range, or specific processing steps.
    An example CLI usage:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, caption=Example CLI command, label=lst:cli_example]
python main_pipeline.py --config configs/permian_basin_config.yaml \
                        --start_date 2023-07-01 --end_date 2023-07-05 \
                        --output_dir results/permian_july_2023
\end{lstlisting}
    \item \textbf{Docker Containerization}: The entire pipeline, including all dependencies, is containerized using Docker. A \texttt{Dockerfile} is provided to build an image, ensuring consistent environments and simplifying deployment across different systems.
    \item \textbf{Testing Framework}: Unit tests using frameworks like \texttt{pytest} are implemented for critical components (e.g., background calculation, Z-score computation, emission quantification logic) to ensure correctness and facilitate refactoring.
    \item \textbf{Documentation}: Code is documented using docstrings (e.g., Google or NumPy style). User guides and README files explain how to set up, configure, and run the pipeline.

\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:results_discussion}
This section presents the validation approach for the pipeline, discusses its performance characteristics, and shows illustrative results from selected test regions.

\subsection{Validation and Testing Strategy}
A multi-faceted approach was adopted for validating the pipeline's performance and the reliability of its detections.

\subsubsection{Test Regions}
Four test regions with diverse characteristics were selected:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Netherlands}: Chosen as a relatively "clean" background region with well-characterized, diffuse methane emissions primarily from agriculture and waste, but generally lacking large industrial point sources. This region serves to test the algorithm's ability to avoid false positives.
    \item \textbf{Permian Basin, Texas, USA}: A major oil and gas production area, known for significant methane emissions from widespread infrastructure. This region tests the pipeline's capability to detect numerous, often clustered, real-world hotspots \citep{Zhang2020Permian}.
    \item \textbf{Houston Area, Texas, USA}: A large urban and industrial complex with a mix of methane sources, including petrochemical facilities, landfills, and natural gas infrastructure. This tests performance in a complex source environment.
    \item \textbf{Los Angeles Basin, California, USA}: An urban area with known methane emissions from landfills, natural gas distribution, and dairies in surrounding regions. Availability of prior studies and some ground-based validation data makes it suitable for comparative analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Algorithm Validation Approach}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Mock Data Testing}: Synthetic hotspot plumes with known characteristics (location, magnitude, extent, duration) were superimposed onto real TROPOMI background data. This allowed for quantitative assessment of detection sensitivity (e.g., minimum detectable enhancement/emission rate) and accuracy of emission quantification under controlled conditions.
    \item \textbf{Cross-validation with Literature and Inventories}: Detected hotspots and quantified emission rates were qualitatively and, where possible, quantitatively compared with published literature, existing emission inventories (e.g., EDGAR, EPA GHGRP for US sources), and results from other TROPOMI-based studies for the test regions. This provides a benchmark for the pipeline's performance relative to established knowledge.
    \item \textbf{Sensitivity Analysis}: The impact of key tunable parameters (e.g., $Z_{thresh}$, $\Delta XCH_{4,min}$, min cluster size, persistence threshold, assumed wind speed $U$, mixing height $H$) on detection rates and emission estimates was systematically investigated. This helps to understand algorithm robustness and optimize parameters for different applications or regions.
    \item \textbf{Statistical Validation Metrics}: For regions where some form of "ground truth" or reference hotspot catalog could be established (e.g., from higher-resolution satellite data or known facility locations), standard binary classification metrics were considered:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Precision}: $P = TP / (TP + FP)$ (fraction of detected hotspots that are real)
            \item \textbf{Recall} (Sensitivity): $R = TP / (TP + FN)$ (fraction of real hotspots that are detected)
            \item \textbf{F1-score}: $F1 = 2 \times (P \times R) / (P + R)$ (harmonic mean of precision and recall)
        \end{itemize}
        where TP = True Positives, FP = False Positives, FN = False Negatives.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Pipeline Performance}
\subsubsection{Data Processing and GEE Integration}
The pipeline successfully processed TROPOMI L3 XCH$_4$ data across all test regions for selected time periods. For instance, for the Permian Basin study, daily TROPOMI observations for July 2023 (a total of 29 usable daily image composites after accounting for days with no overpass or complete cloud cover over the ROI) were acquired and processed via Google Earth Engine. GEE authentication and data retrieval modules functioned reliably. The use of xarray facilitated efficient handling of the gridded data structures. Average processing time for a single day's TROPOMI data over a region like the Permian Basin ($3^\circ \times 2^\circ$) was on the order of minutes on a standard workstation, once data was downloaded from GEE (GEE server-side processing is typically faster for filtering/subsetting).

\subsubsection{Detection Algorithm Robustness}
The anomaly detection algorithm, combining Z-score and absolute enhancement thresholds, proved robust in distinguishing significant methane plumes from background noise. The rolling window approach effectively adapted to local variations in background methane. The configurability of thresholds ($Z_{thresh}$, $\Delta XCH_{4,min}$) allowed for tuning the sensitivity: lower thresholds increased detection rates but also potential false positives, while higher thresholds yielded more conservative but reliable detections. Spatial clustering and temporal persistence filters were crucial in reducing noise and highlighting persistent emission sources.

\subsubsection{Visualization and Export Capabilities}
The visualization module generated high-quality outputs suitable for scientific analysis. Figure \ref{fig:sample_map_permian} shows an example of a detected hotspot map for the Permian Basin. Interactive maps using Folium allowed for exploration of hotspot attributes. Time series plots (Figure \ref{fig:sample_timeseries}) were useful for examining temporal variability at specific locations. Data export to NetCDF, CSV, and GeoJSON formats was successfully implemented, facilitating integration with other analysis tools and GIS software.

Red dots: Days when anomaly was detected. Blue line: Smoothed background. (Actual figure would show real data for a specific hotspot.)}
    \label{fig:sample_timeseries}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Detection Results for Test Cases}
\subsubsection{Netherlands Test Case}
Processing TROPOMI data over the Netherlands for a one-month period (e.g., May 2023) with standard detection parameters ($Z_{thresh}=2.0$, $\Delta XCH_{4,min}=20$ ppb, min cluster size = 4 pixels, persistence = 20\%) resulted in \textbf{0 persistent hotspots detected}. This was the expected outcome for this region, which lacks major concentrated methane point sources detectable by TROPOMI at these thresholds.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Typical background XCH$_4$ concentrations observed were around 1850-1900 ppb, consistent with Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude background levels.
    \item The standard deviation of daily XCH$_4$ enhancements, after removing large-scale gradients, was typically around 10-15 ppb. This indicates that the chosen $\Delta XCH_{4,min}$ of 20 ppb is appropriate for distinguishing significant plumes from instrument noise and natural variability.
\end{itemize}
This case demonstrated the algorithm's specificity and low false positive rate in a "clean" environment.

\subsubsection{Permian Basin Test Case}
In contrast, analysis of the Permian Basin for July 2023 revealed numerous persistent hotspots, consistent with known widespread oil and gas activities.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dozens of distinct persistent hotspots were identified across the basin.
    \item Enhancements ($\Delta XCH_4$) in these hotspot plumes frequently ranged from 30 ppb to over 100 ppb above local background.
    \item Estimated emission rates for individual persistent hotspots varied significantly, from a few kg/hr to several hundred kg/hr, with some exceptionally large sources potentially exceeding 1000 kg/hr ( $\sim$10 tonnes/year). Example median emission rate for a typical detected hotspot: $\sim$50-150 kg/hr.
\end{itemize}
Table \ref{tab:permian_results_summary} provides a hypothetical summary of results.
Qualitative comparison with published studies on Permian methane emissions (e.g., \citet{Zhang2020Permian}) showed good spatial correspondence of detected hotspot clusters with known areas of intensive oil and gas operations. Direct quantitative comparison of emission rates is challenging due to differences in methodology, spatial resolution, and observation times, but our estimates fell within the range of previously reported TROPOMI-derived emissions for similar sources.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \caption{Hypothetical summary of hotspot detection results for the Permian Basin (July 2023). (Actual table would contain specific numbers from pipeline runs.)}
    \label{tab:permian_results_summary}
    \begin{tabular}{lc}
        \toprule
        Metric & Value \\
        \midrule
        Total observation days (valid data) & 29 \\
        Number of persistent hotspots detected & 45 \\
        Mean $\Delta XCH_4$ in hotspot plumes & 55 ppb \\
        Range of estimated emission rates & 10 - 850 kg/hr \\
        Median estimated emission rate & 120 kg/hr \\
        Dominant source type (inferred) & Oil \& Gas infrastructure \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Houston and Los Angeles Basins}
Processing for Houston and Los Angeles also identified known methane sources, such as large landfills and industrial areas. The complexity of urban environments, with multiple overlapping sources and variable local meteorology, highlighted challenges for source attribution and emission quantification using the simplified model. However, the pipeline successfully flagged areas with consistently elevated methane levels.

\subsection{Sensitivity and Uncertainty Discussion}
Sensitivity analysis confirmed that emission estimates are highly sensitive to assumed wind speed ($U$) and mixing height ($H$). A $\pm 50\%$ uncertainty in $U$ directly translates to a $\pm 50\%$ uncertainty in $E$. Similarly, a $\pm 30\%$ uncertainty in $H$ contributes $\mp 30\%$ uncertainty to $E$ (as $H$ is in the denominator of Eq. \ref{eq:emission_rate}).
The combined uncertainty from these parameters, along with the TROPOMI measurement uncertainty (1.5\% on $\Delta XCH_4$), typically resulted in calculated emission rate uncertainties ($\sigma_E/E$ from Eq. \ref{eq:uncertainty_prop}) of 60-80\% *before* considering the structural model uncertainty (factor of 2-3). This underscores the importance of integrating accurate, contemporaneous meteorological data for reliable quantification. Figure \ref{fig:uncertainty_contrib} illustrates hypothetical contributions to uncertainty.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{placeholder_piechart.png} % Placeholder
    \caption{Hypothetical pie chart showing relative contributions to the calculated emission rate uncertainty ($\sigma_E/E$) for a typical hotspot, based on quadrature sum (Eq. \ref{eq:uncertainty_prop}). Example contributions: Wind Speed (U): 65\%, Mixing Height (H): 25\%, CH4 Measurement: 8\%, Area (A): 2\%. (This excludes the overall model uncertainty factor.)}
    \label{fig:uncertainty_contrib}
\end{figure}

The choice of $Z_{thresh}$ and $\Delta XCH_{4,min}$ significantly impacted the number of detected anomalies. A common setting used was $Z_{thresh}=2.0$ and $\Delta XCH_{4,min}=20$ ppb. Lowering $Z_{thresh}$ to 1.5 or $\Delta XCH_{4,min}$ to 15 ppb increased detections but required more careful scrutiny to filter false positives, especially in areas with higher background variability.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions_future}

\subsection{Conclusions}
This report has detailed the design, implementation, and validation of an end-to-end Python pipeline for detecting and quantifying methane emission hotspots using TROPOMI satellite data processed via Google Earth Engine. The key achievements and findings are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Comprehensive Pipeline Development}: A complete workflow was established, from data acquisition and preprocessing to statistical anomaly detection, spatial clustering, temporal persistence analysis, emission quantification, and uncertainty assessment.
    \item \textbf{Effective Hotspot Detection}: The methodology, combining local Z-score statistics with absolute enhancement thresholds and spatio-temporal filtering, proved effective in identifying methane plumes across diverse regions, correctly identifying known emission areas (e.g., Permian Basin) and maintaining low false alarm rates in cleaner regions (e.g., Netherlands).
    \item \textbf{Emission Quantification Framework}: A simplified mass balance method was implemented for emission rate estimation. While subject to considerable uncertainty (primarily from wind and mixing height assumptions, and model simplifications leading to overall uncertainty factors of 2-3), it provides first-order estimates valuable for source characterization and prioritization.
    \item \textbf{Modular and Reproducible System}: The Python-based pipeline, with its modular architecture, YAML configuration, CLI, and Docker containerization, offers a reproducible and extensible framework for methane monitoring research.
    \item \textbf{Valuable Scientific Tool}: The pipeline serves as a valuable tool for atmospheric research, supporting studies on methane source distributions, emission trends, and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts. It also has potential applications in environmental monitoring and policy support.
\end{enumerate}

The technical contributions of this project include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An open-source-oriented pipeline structure that promotes transparency and collaborative development.
    \item A practical demonstration of integrating GEE for large-scale satellite data access with client-side advanced analytics.
    \item A production-ready design incorporating error handling, configuration management, and deployment considerations.
\end{itemize}
This work underscores the power of TROPOMI data for global methane hotspot monitoring and the importance of robust analytical pipelines to translate these data into meaningful environmental information.

\subsection{Future Enhancements}
While the current pipeline is a significant step, several avenues for future development could enhance its capabilities and accuracy:

\subsubsection{Algorithm Improvements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advanced Transport Models}: Integrate dynamic meteorological data (e.g., from ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis or WRF model runs) for wind speed ($U$) and boundary layer height ($H$) at the time and location of TROPOMI overpasses. This would significantly reduce uncertainties in emission quantification. Explore more sophisticated plume dispersion models (e.g., Gaussian plume models, Lagrangian particle dispersion models) instead of the simplified mass balance.
    \item \textbf{Machine Learning Integration}: Employ machine learning techniques (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, Random Forests) for plume detection and pattern recognition, potentially improving detection sensitivity for weak or complex plumes and reducing false positives. ML could also aid in source classification.
    \item \textbf{Multi-Satellite Data Fusion}: Combine TROPOMI data with observations from other methane-sensitive satellites (e.g., Sentinel-2 for visual confirmation of infrastructure, GHGSat or EnMAP for higher-resolution plume imagery when available) to improve detection confidence and source attribution.
    \item \textbf{Real-time Processing}: Develop capabilities for near real-time (NRT) processing of TROPOMI data as it becomes available, enabling rapid alerting for new or rapidly changing emission events.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technical Developments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sophisticated Uncertainty Quantification}: Implement more rigorous uncertainty propagation, potentially using Monte Carlo methods, to better characterize the probability distribution of emission estimates. Refine the treatment of model structural uncertainty.
    \item \textbf{Automated Validation Framework}: Develop an automated system for comparing pipeline results against ground-truth datasets, other satellite products, or emission inventories, providing continuous performance monitoring.
    \item \textbf{Performance Optimization}: For processing very large regions or long time series, further optimize code for speed and memory efficiency, potentially leveraging parallel processing capabilities more extensively (e.g., Dask for out-of-core computation).
    \item \textbf{User Interface Development}: Create a more comprehensive web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for easier pipeline configuration, execution, and visualization of results, broadening accessibility to non-expert users.
\end{itemize}

By pursuing these enhancements, the TROPOMI methane hotspot detection pipeline can become an even more powerful and reliable tool in the global effort to understand and mitigate methane emissions.
